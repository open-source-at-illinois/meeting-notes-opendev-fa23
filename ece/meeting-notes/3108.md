**Meeting with IEEE**

Parts selection limited by mouser and digi-key


- Efinix is cheap but sketchy, toolchain is built by 14 taiwanese dudes, the docs are terrible not a good fpga to go with
- Lead times on digi-key and mouser are just made up by people
- Intel Altera's looking nice
- Stick to 7 series, or ice 40s from latus
- FPGA toolchains and bit stream generation - none of it opensource from official companies
- Reverse engineer bitstream generation for spartan 7s and latus 40s
- Yosys, bitstream generator, (barely works), F4pga - those are 'open-source'
- 2 guys working on yosys, routing quality is very bad
- Yosys synthesis to netstream , and then convert to bitstream


- Tools that do synthesis is very complicated, and also proprietary and protected
- Switches, off chain ram, switches, building a softcore cpu using RTL.

- Hardware needs to be planned way more in advanced
- Open-Source hardware will have no impact on the Open-Source software

- 150$ will get you 40k-100K CLBs
- Seems like once you hit 100,000 LUTS - for instock

- Use ZYNQ 7Z010, SOC stuff put linux on there

- Very easy to run kinux on a ZYNQ 7000

- Embedded hekper core, memory mapped core, easier than trying to get 2 mil LUTS FPGA

- Need 300k LUTs

- Do anything with RTL

- Ki-Cad, open-source the gerbers - just do PCB design


- Synthesize a RISC-V core that can NOT run linux
-   Make your own soft core (easier part)
-   Make your own tool chain
-   Hard part is making an IDE that compiles to your type of memory map
-   Trapnsose, run instruction code run on it, but getting c compilation is the hard part


- RISC-V for embedded stuff, specifiy the ISA
- Multiple issues
-   RISC-V tool chain is unstable, tough to make sure it compiles correctly,
-   When you write C, assume existence of a standard lib
-   Running C bare metal, make sure of ABI - stack pointers working, which is hard because no kernel
-   391 in RISC-V instead of x86


- Modular design PCIE based
- Swappable PCI module
- Hot swap FPGA
- Open-Source interface, with design periplherals, go write PCIE
 

DRC is the first layer of the PCB debugging puyramid
Hardware platform on whic people can learn high speed design - limited resources (for the most part it is something that is an acquired taste)
A LOT of considerations with high speed stuff
- EMI
- Power Stages
- Switching Power Regulators
- 1.1, 1,8, 3.3V rails - need a buck for switching regulators
- Inducatance, and transmission line matching
- under a 100 MHz
- Cost balance, tented viers between layers in the board
- Iterationg on PCB design is tough,

- JLC PCB - 2/3 weeks minimum
- Biggest challenge is the iteration speed
- Costs balloon as well

- FPGAs are software where you can reglash them, modularity would be good
- Have a duaghter board, FPGA, either a RAM on the daughter board (SDRAM) - redesign daughter board when swapping FPGAs

Cool hardware wise
- modular highspeed system using a less expensive fpga
- swappable interface
- figuring out a high speed swappable part

- Make a softcore, flash with something

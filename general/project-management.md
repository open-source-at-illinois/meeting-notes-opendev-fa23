## Scrum Roles:

- Product Owner: The project directors and the other project leads are product owners. This will provide a mix of functional "stories" as well as technical design discussions.

- Scrum Master: The project leads are the SCRUM masters.

## Scrum Framework:

Sprints: Divide your project timeline into time-bound iterations called "sprints." Given your time constraints, consider having 2-week sprints. This allows for manageable commitments within the 4-6 hours per week availability of team members.

Backlog: Maintain a product backlog for the entire club, where you list all the features and tasks that need to be completed. Break down tasks to a size that can be accomplished within a single sprint. The tasks (smallest divisions of a feature) will be added to the project board. A markdown document with a indented hiearchy system and checkboxes can be used to divide tasks. eg: 

(
- Improve UI of website
  - Add Navbar
    - [x] create component
    - [ ] configure styling
    - [ ] add links to other pages
    - [ ] test
  - Etc
    - [ ] etc
    
) 

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, hold a sprint planning meeting. The Product Owner and the respective project lead collaborate to prioritize and select tasks from the backlog for the upcoming sprint.

Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, hold a sprint review meeting. Each project team demonstrates the completed work to the club, including any prototypes, designs, or code developed during the sprint. Since there is at least one meeting per week per team, every second week can be a Sprint review, while the other one can be a mid-sprint check-in. Alternatively, we could do this in the bi-weekly OpenDev meet.

Sprint Retrospective: Also at the end of each sprint, have a retrospective meeting where teams discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to enhance the process for the next sprint.

Monthly? design reviews: Every 4 weeks (every other Sprint Review) can be a design review. This will consist of others (project directors, other project leads, possibly other external members) evaluating the current design and the project team defending and justifying each design decision.


## Adaptations for Your Situation:

Flexible Team Size: Since the team size might vary, ensure that tasks are broken down into smaller units so that they can be handled by any number of team members. This ensures that even if some members leave, others can still pick up the work.

Task Distribution: During sprint planning, distribute tasks based on team members' availability and skills. This ensures that everyone has a role and contributes effectively.

Rotating Responsibilities: Given that you have multiple project subjects, you could consider rotating team members across projects to maintain engagement and learning opportunities.


## Notes

Difficult to get tasks done if people are not committed to working

How to incorporate learning into it- small learning tasks, review at the end of the week

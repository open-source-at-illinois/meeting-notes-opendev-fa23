## Scrum Roles:

- Product Owner: As the project director, you could take on the role of the Product Owner. You'll be responsible for prioritizing project features, setting goals, and ensuring alignment with the club's objectives.

- Scrum Master: Designate someone as the Scrum Master. This person will facilitate meetings, remove obstacles, and ensure the team follows Scrum practices.

- Project Leads: Each project's lead can act as a Scrum Master for their respective teams, responsible for guiding their teams through the Scrum process.

## Scrum Framework:

Sprints: Divide your project timeline into time-bound iterations called "sprints." Given your time constraints, consider having 2-week sprints. This allows for manageable commitments within the 4-6 hours per week availability of team members.

Backlog: Maintain a product backlog for the entire club, where you list all the features and tasks that need to be completed. Break down tasks to a size that can be accomplished within a single sprint.

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, hold a sprint planning meeting. The Product Owner and the respective project lead collaborate to prioritize and select tasks from the backlog for the upcoming sprint.

Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, hold a sprint review meeting. Each project team demonstrates the completed work to the club, including any prototypes, designs, or code developed during the sprint.

Sprint Retrospective: Also at the end of each sprint, have a retrospective meeting where teams discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to enhance the process for the next sprint.

## Adaptations for Your Situation:

Flexible Team Size: Since the team size might vary, ensure that tasks are broken down into smaller units so that they can be handled by any number of team members. This ensures that even if some members leave, others can still pick up the work.

Task Distribution: During sprint planning, distribute tasks based on team members' availability and skills. This ensures that everyone has a role and contributes effectively.

Rotating Responsibilities: Given that you have multiple project subjects, you could consider rotating team members across projects to maintain engagement and learning opportunities.

Remember that Agile frameworks are designed to be flexible, so feel free to adapt the approach as needed to suit your club's unique dynamics and goals. The key is to maintain open communication, foster collaboration, and continuously improve your processes based on feedback from your teams.

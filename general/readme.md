### Bi-weekly OpenDev Meeting
In Person meeting between all members and project leads from OpenDev.

Goal is community building 

- An opportunity to just socialise, less formal and serious.
- Maybe people can discuss new tech/ developments
- We can rent out board games etc


## Notes
- Break tasks down into very small deliverables, PR for each deliverable
- Associated task assigned on github projects.
- Fetch/ pull procedure clearly outlined somewhere
- Add clear tags to issues. Allows them to be found by others.
- contributing.md

### Meeting protocols

### Project management protocols

### Git protocols

### Bi-weekly OpenDev Meeting
In Person meeting between all members and project leads from OpenDev.

Goal is community building 

- An opportunity to just socialise, less formal and serious.
- Maybe people can discuss new tech/ developments
- We can rent out board games etc


## Notes
- Break tasks down into very small deliverables, PR for each deliverable
- Associated task assigned on github projects.
- Fetch/ pull procedure clearly outlined somewhere

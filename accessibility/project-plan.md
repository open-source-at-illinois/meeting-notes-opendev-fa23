# Open-Source @ Illinois | (Possibly) Accessibility Team 
General Guidelines:
- One of the biggest issues of open-source anything right now is duplication of effort and fragmentation of ideas. Hence, this team will work improving good FOSS projects rather than creating new ones.
- Need to do stuff that is achievable in one semester. Once again, easier to do when contributing to an established project rather than starting a new one

## Final Project: An exploration of VDO.Ninja and an introduction to contributing to open-source projects
### Semester Plan
Planned project span: 14 weeks

1. Exploration of the project, trying to run the project, finding issues, making project plans (2 weeks)
2. Learning the required tools used to contribute to VDO.Ninja, setting up a development environment (2 weeks + ongoing)
3. Two development sprints (simple feature enhancements like #730, #802, #656, #679) (2x2 weeks)
4. First integration/buffer week
5. Two development sprints (either more enhancements or bug fixes like #474, #600) (2x2 weeks)
6. Second integration/buffer week

If parts 1 and 2 take longer, we'll skip out on integration weeks

## Open-Source Input Devices
Could be any input device. Could be a video game controller, mouse, joystick/trackpoint, keyboard, etc. 
### Alpakka Controller
- Goal: to improve the Alpakka controller. They do have a road map including features like wireless operation(radios and batteries), more game profiles, etc.
- Tools and Technologies used: CAD, PCB Design, Firmware in C
- Funding Requirement: $100 - 200 a controller, plan to have at least two for testing different things

- https://inputlabs.io/alpakka
- Asked on the discord for collaboration opportunities

### Controller Customization App
- Drivers to make a widely used controller usable on a different platform
- Controls remapping for accessibility // Done well by steam

### Using the Framework Touchpad with standalone desktops
- Goal: To use the framework laptop touchpad as an external standalone touchpad
- Tools and technologies used: Can be done with an Arduino and the Framework Laptop 13 touchpad with a 3D printed enclosure
- Funding requirement: Probably about $60 a unit given the touchpad itself is $39.

- Possibly better to do this after a while as the new framework laptop 16 came out and its customizable input modules could be a game changer.

## Contributing to Software
### Dock to home assistant
- Goal: to create an app / launcher which lets the phone be used in a dock mode.
- Should be able to do music, weather, notes, timers/alarms, etc.
- Tools used: Android Studio, Java/Kotlin
- Funding reqirements: Nearly nothing

### Use phone as gadget/hub when on PC (stream deck?)
- Can also do as a presentation remote (HOW IS THIS NOT MAINSTREAM ALREADY)
- There's so many utilities that can be replaced by phones huh. 
- https://github.com/ecrax/streamdeck (Seems to be for OBS specifically)
- https://github.com/Macro-Deck-App/Macro-Deck (This seems much more used)

- Goal: Add linux compatibility to stream deck, or write some plugins!
- Tools: C# and .NET
- Funding Requirement: Nearly none

### Use phone as webcam/microphone for PC
- Make a tool to connect phone to PC and use it as a webcam and microphone (especially useful for desktop)
- Goal: make (or make better) a tool that lets you use your phone as a webcam and microphone
- Shouldn't be too hard, can definitely get this done in a semester
- Should be possible to add cross platform support without too much effort
- Tools: Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)/ IP Streaming
- Funding: Nearly none (that's the point)

Current Tools:
- Droidcam (Not FOSS)
- Spydroid (tried, doesn't work great, last update few years ago, no longer worth using)
- VDO.Ninja (Tried, passable, needs work). Need to see how to get it running over LAN or maybe connected to the device directly. Uses OBS, need to see if there's a way to not need it

Goal: get to a point where you can have a cam up and running in 10 minutes.

# Open-Source @ Illinois | (Possibly) Accessibility Team 
General Guidelines:
- One of the biggest issues of open-source anything right now is duplication of effort and fragmentation of ideas. Hence, this team will work improving good FOSS projects rather than creating new ones.
- Need to do stuff that is achievable in one semester. Once again, easier to do when contributing to an established project rather than starting a new one

## Final Project: An exploration of VDO.Ninja and an introduction to contributing to open-source projects
### Semester Plan
Planned project span: 14 weeks

1. Exploration of the project, trying to run the project, finding issues, making project plans (2 weeks)
2. Learning the required tools used to contribute to VDO.Ninja, setting up a development environment (2 weeks + ongoing)
3. Two development sprints (simple feature enhancements like #730, #802, #656, #679) (2x2 weeks)
4. First integration/buffer week
5. Two development sprints (either more enhancements or bug fixes like #474, #600) (2x2 weeks)
6. Second integration/buffer week

If parts 1 and 2 take longer, we'll skip out on integration weeks

### Objectives
- Make a tool to connect phone to PC and use it as a webcam and microphone (especially useful for desktop)
- Goal: make (or make better) a tool that lets you use your phone as a webcam and microphone
- Shouldn't be too hard, can definitely get this done in a semester
- Should be possible to add cross platform support without too much effort
- Tools: Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)/ IP Streaming
- Funding: Nearly none (that's the point)

### Alternates
- Droidcam (Not FOSS)
- Spydroid (tried, doesn't work great, last update few years ago, no longer worth using)

(Initial) Goal: get to a point where you can have a cam up and running in 10 minutes.

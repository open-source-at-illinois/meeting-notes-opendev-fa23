## Open-Source Input Devices
Could be any input device. Could be a video game controller, mouse, joystick/trackpoint, keyboard, etc. 
### Alpakka Controller
- Goal: to improve the Alpakka controller. They do have a road map including features like wireless operation(radios and batteries), more game profiles, etc.
- Tools and Technologies used: CAD, PCB Design, Firmware in C
- Funding Requirement: $100 - 200 a controller, plan to have at least two for testing different things

- Asked on the discord for collaboration opportunities

### Controller Customization App
- Drivers to make a widely used controller usable on a different platform
- Controls remapping for accessibility // Done well by steam

### Using the Framework Touchpad with standalone desktops
- Goal: To use the framework laptop touchpad as an external standalone touchpad
- Tools and technologies used: Can be done with an Arduino and the Framework Laptop 13 touchpad with a 3D printed enclosure
- Funding requirement: Probably about $60 a unit given the touchpad itself is $39.

- Possibly better to do this after a while as the new framework laptop 16 came out and its customizable input modules could be a game changer.

## Contributing to Software
### Dock to home assistant
- Goal: to create an app / launcher which lets the phone be used in a dock mode.
- Should be able to do music, weather, notes, timers/alarms, etc.
- Tools used: Android Studio, Java/Kotlin
- Funding reqirements: Nearly nothing

### Use phone as gadget/hub when on PC (stream deck?)
- Can also do as a presentation remote (HOW IS THIS NOT MAINSTREAM ALREADY)
- There's so many utilities that can be replaced by phones huh. 
- https://github.com/ecrax/streamdeck (Seems to be for OBS specifically)
- https://github.com/Macro-Deck-App/Macro-Deck (This seems much more used)

- Goal: Add linux compatibility to stream deck, or write some plugins!
- Tools: C# and .NET
- Funding Requirement: Nearly none
